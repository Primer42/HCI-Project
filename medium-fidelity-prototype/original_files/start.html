Welcome to the Job Tracking Demo!  
<p>
This is a user interface demo for a job, network or position tracking program designed by William Richard and Guvenc Usanmaz.
<p>
This is merely a demo, mostly to display our user interface layout and is not fully functional.
<p>
Most notably, you will not be able to add your own arbitrary entries to this program.  
For example, if you want to add a job, it will have to be a pre-populated job. You will not be able to type in your own information about the job.
<p>
Also, there are a few features which are currently not present that  will be present for the interactive program.
