How to use this Higher Fidelity Prototype:

This is a php website, and thus needs to be hosted at a location.  For the purposes of this readme, we'll be hosting the site on your local machine.
This isn't the only way to host it, just an easy one.

1) Download and install XAMPP for your computer from http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
2) XAMPP should have created a directory somewhere called 'xampp/htdocs' which is the hosted directory. Find it.
3) Add our code to a subdirectory of xampp/htdocs, either by copying the code or cloning it from github to that directory.
3.1) To clone to a specific location using the github GUI, first stop tracking the repository, then go to the repository page, right click on the "HCI-Project" repository, and select 'clone to...' and select xampp/htdocs.
4) Start apache using the xampp control panel.
5) Open start.php from the higher fidelity prototype.
