<TextField4 xfdf:original="Which tasks were easy to complete?">They all were easy to complete, but many could have been completed more efficiently.</TextField4>
<TextField5 xfdf:original="Can you identify why the solutions were clear?">Because it wasn't crowded, and there weren't a lot of distracting buttons.  When I needed to add a person, all I had to do was click a button marked "people."</TextField5>
<TextField6 xfdf:original="Which tasks were difficult to complete?">None, but some could be more efficient.</TextField6>
<TextField7 xfdf:original="How would you make those tasks easier to complete?">Making them more hooked together.  Having to click on separate tabs to make one new job entry is annoying.  I want to be able to enter things in a more streamlined process.</TextField7>
<TextField8 xfdf:original="Were there any instructions, vocabulary or labels that you found confusing?">Yes, the introduction page had technical jargon that I didn't understand about multiple objects.  Also, once I got a little bit confused I just stopped reading it altogether, missing the point that the entries I was making were all hypothetical and I wouldn't be able to put in my own information.</TextField8>
