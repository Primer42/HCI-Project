\section{Features from Previous Assignments}
We incorporated much of the design from previous assignments into this prototype.  The syntactic flow of the user actions, as well as the general layout of the pages have remained the same from the original specifications and the storyboards.

\section{Differences from design and implementation}
There aren't many decisions that are different from the design, rather things that we were unable to implement from the design.  These include, but are not limited to
\begin{itemize}
\item View object details on a separate page
\item Editing objects
\item Deleting objects
\item Specifying relations between objects
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations of Prototype Caused by the Software}
