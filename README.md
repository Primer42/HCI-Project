HCI-Project
===========

HCI Project for Tufts 171 - Human Computer Interaction.

This is a website that helps you track your job search - who you've talked to, what jobs you're interested in, and where you are in the application process.

It was my first ever website, designed from scratch, as well as my first ever attempt at designing a UI from scratch.  We had very little time to complete it, and it's for sure not a finished product by any means, but I learned a lot from it.
